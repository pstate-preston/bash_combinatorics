This directory was created to hold scripts to practice bash scripting, using formulas in combinatorics to perform various functions.
Each function should contain proper structure to perform its task with large numbers using the bc library. They should each contain --h and --help flags to demonstrate use.
The directory is added to the system PATH. This means that each function, once executable, can be used anywhere in the system.

Function list:  Factorial
		Permute
		Binomial Coefficient (nchoosek)
		Multichoose
		Permute with repeated choices
		Permutation of a multiset
		Derangements
		Stirling Numbers



Completed: Factorial
	   Permute
	   Binomial Coefficient
	   Multichoose
	   Permute with repeated choices
	   Derangements/Subfactorial
	   Permutation of a Multiset


Task List: 
		1.) Add -h and --help flags
		2.) Employ factorial script and reuse other scripts as much as possible.
		3.) Ensure use of large numbers(using bc function) and test.
		4.) Ensure only exact number of valid arguments can be accepted

		** 5.) Rework subfactorial to allow for large numbers. Not sure why passing to bc is not computing larger numbers.


Create: 
	1.) Stirling numbers
	2.) Generating Functions
